@charge is a class that is meant to provoide some simplified plotting functions related to point charges

contour overloads the contour plot function to generate a potential map that is caused by the point charges

quiver and quiver3 overload the respective vector plotting functions to generate a vector field of the net electric field generated by the point charges
